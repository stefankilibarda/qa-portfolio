# Test Design Techniques â€“ 2BVA Example

This folder contains an example exercise demonstrating the **Two-Value Boundary Analysis (2BVA)** black-box test design technique.

## ðŸ“‹ Contents
- **2bva_examples.md** â€“ Contains the solution for exercises 1, 1.2, and 1.3 from a training session, using a realistic scenario to demonstrate:
  - Identifying valid and invalid input boundaries.
  - Selecting representative test values at the edges of input domains.
  - Organizing test cases in a clear tabular format.

## ðŸ›  Purpose
The goal of this example is to showcase:
- Practical application of **boundary value analysis** to identify defects that might occur at input limits.
- Structured test documentation for easy understanding by both QA and development teams.
- Clear separation of **valid**, **invalid**, and **edge** cases.

> âš  **Note:** The example is based on a training exercise and does not contain any confidential application data.
