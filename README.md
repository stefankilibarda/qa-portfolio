## 🚀 How to Explore

1. Browse each project’s folder for its own `README.md` file.
2. For automation projects, follow the installation steps in their READMEs to run tests locally.
3. Manual testing examples, test plans, and bug reports are view-only in `.md` format.
4. MySQL exercises can be reviewed directly but require your own database to execute.
