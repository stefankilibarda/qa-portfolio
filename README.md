## 🚀 How to Explore

1. Browse each project’s folder for its own `README.md` file.
2. Follow the installation steps in project READMEs to run automated tests locally.
3. Review manual testing docs in the `docs/` folder *(to be added)*.

## 📌 Notes
- Each subfolder is an independent project with its own configuration and dependencies.
- Sensitive data (e.g., credentials) is never committed – environment variables are used instead.
- `node_modules` and other generated files are excluded via `.gitignore`.
